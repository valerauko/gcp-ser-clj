A Clojure library trying to make reporting errors to Google Cloud's Error Reporting system (Stackdriver) simpler.

## Usage

### Using `report`

You can use the `report` directly to easily report an error to GCP.

```clojure
(try
  (throw (ex-info "Something bad happened" {:important :data}))
  (catch Throwable ex
    (report ex))
```

### Using `with-error-reporting`

`with-error-reporting` makes reporting even easier, as it automatically reports the exceptions that occur in its scope. It re-throws the exceptions so you can decide how to handle them in your application.

```clojure
(with-error-reporting
  (throw (ex-info "Something bad happened" {:important :data})))
```
